* Never Take Anyone's Words For Granted, everyone has their own opinion,

    {    
       Never judge someone or something solely based upon how other people describes them, judge everyone and everything for yourself.
   }


Everyone is different and unique in their own fashion. What might look trashy to you might be a diamond for others...

>>> *Maid Sama*    was an wonderful shujo anime yet, at first because of giving priority to others opinion instead of looking 
>>>  		for myself I really thought it was a trashy shujo anime. I head my reviews about it was all about maids and
>>> 	      was a harem type, romance only with no plot at all. That's why I was in a mindset of finding some copper in this anime, but 
>>>  	    what I found wasn't copper it was Gold...

that's why never judge a book from others opinion, always go throgh it yourself and then judge for youself
sometimes poeple also fail to really express themselves in a decent manner, sometimes our words convery a meaning
what's completely opposite of how we really feel. That's why it's okay to be mistaken, it's okay to make mistakes,
because without them life would to dull and boring...
